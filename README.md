 ## About Me
 ---
Hi my name is Jordi Simbana. I'm 15 years old and I currently attend the _Highschool of Telecommunications Arts and Technology_.   
I enjoy learning about cameras and anything related to production (camera operating, editing, sound engineering, etc.). I am currently serving at my local church, [Resurrection Church](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU8aD0VIGdrvPeDZc-s-gnw) 
doing behind the scenes work on the online services. I really enjoy doing it and I hope to get better as I grow more.
